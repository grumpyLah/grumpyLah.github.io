While mastering the basics, the real breakthrough came when I started using **ChatGPT (GenAi)** to guide me. ChatGPT has been a great help in explaining concepts in detail and helping me execute tasks with confidence.

I am grateful for the insights ChatGPT provided, which helped me improve both the functionality and visual appeal of my project.
