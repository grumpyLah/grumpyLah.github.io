## ðŸ”¥ Year 2: OBKD Project

In **Year 2**, I worked on a project that focused on **candlestick charts** generated from historical data retrieved through **API Calls**. This project was a great learning experience, combining data analysis and visualization techniques.

The video below demonstrates the functionality of the OBKD Project, where we visualize the candlestick charts based on real-time data.
