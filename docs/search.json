While mastering the basics, the real breakthrough came when I started using ChatGPT (GenAi) to guide me. ChatGPT has been a great help in explaining concepts in detail and helping me execute tasks with confidence.\n\n\n\n\nThroughout this project, we were tasked with creating a navigation bar, which was not part of the lessons. By using ChatGPT, I was able to break down the process and learn how to customize my project further. This experience has enhanced my understanding and allowed me to beautify my work. I am grateful for the insights ChatGPT provided, which helped me improve both the functionality and visual appeal of my project.\n\n\n\nThis exercise has reinforced the value of using AI tools like ChatGPT to accelerate my learning. Moving forward, I am confident in my ability to solve complex tasks independently."
